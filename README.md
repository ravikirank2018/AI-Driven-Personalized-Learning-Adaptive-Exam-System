📅 Project Details
•	📌 Project Name: AI-Driven Personalized Learning & Adaptive Exam System
•	📆 Start Date: February 2025
•	📍 Target Completion: TBD (Based on phases)
•	🎯 Goal: To create an AI-powered learning system that adapts to each student’s learning ability, provides real-time adaptive exams, and gives personalized study recommendations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and AI-driven question generation.
💡 Motivation
•	Why This Project?
•	✅ Traditional learning methods follow a one-size-fits-all approach, where every student is treated the same, despite having different learning speeds.
✅ Students struggle with weak areas but lack personalized recommendations to improve effectively.
✅ AI and Adaptive Learning can revolutionize education by personalizing the learning experience for every student.
🎯 Key Objectives
•	🔹 AI-Powered Adaptive Testing: The system dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on the student’s real-time performance.
🔹 Personalized Study Plans: AI recommends custom learning materials based on weaknesses.
🔹 Dropout Prediction Model: Predicts struggling students and suggests interventions.
🔹 Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Exam Generation: AI learns and improves question selection for better student outcomes.
🔹 Real-time Performance Analytics Dashboard: Allows students and instructors to track progress with AI-driven insights.
