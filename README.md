# 📅 Project Details

## 📌 Project Name: AI-Driven Personalized Learning & Adaptive Exam System

- **📆 Start Date:** February 2025
- **📍 Target Completion:** TBD (Based on phases)
- **🎯 Goal:** To create an AI-powered learning system that adapts to each student’s learning ability, provides real-time adaptive exams, and gives personalized study recommendations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and AI-driven question generation.

## 💡 Motivation

### Why This Project?

✅ Traditional learning methods follow a one-size-fits-all approach, where every student is treated the same, despite having different learning speeds.  
✅ Students struggle with weak areas but lack personalized recommendations to improve effectively.  
✅ AI and Adaptive Learning can revolutionize education by personalizing the learning experience for every student.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- 🔹 **AI-Powered Adaptive Testing:** The system dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on the student’s real-time performance.
- 🔹 **Personalized Study Plans:** AI recommends custom learning materials based on weaknesses.
- 🔹 **Dropout Prediction Model:** Predicts struggling students and suggests interventions.
- 🔹 **Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Exam Generation:** AI learns and improves question selection for better student outcomes.
- 🔹 **Real-time Performance Analytics Dashboard:** Allows students and instructors to track progress with AI-driven insights.
